# Ebook Catalog

## A simple ebook cataloging app for Windows
Hey everyone. Major ebook fan here. I have been looking for an app to catalog my ebook collection for a while now. While something like Calibre has existed forever it is extremely heavy and feels overkill for what I actually wanted from an ebook cataloging app.

I don't really like the term vibe coding so I will just say I used Claude to come up with a simple electron based app that does only what I need.

- Give it access to your ebook folder and it will scan and show your ebooks in a grid or list view.
- Add or remove books from your folder and they should update in the app in realtime.
- Epubs can be read in the app itself but this is just to be able to see contents. It dosen't store your read progress etc
- PDFs have a link to open them in your default app.
- Docx and Mobi files will show up in the app but without any covers.
- You can give a Rating to books and mark them as Reading OR Read.
- You can add notes to any book.

**NOTE**: I haven't tested this extensively and I don't assume any responsibility for data loss or performance.

**INSTALLATION**: Download and extract anywhere and run the app. That's it.

Would love to know if this actually works for some of you
